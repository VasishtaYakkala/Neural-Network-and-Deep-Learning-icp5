1.Adding hidden layer to autoencoder
2.Do the prediction on the test data and then visualizing one of the reconstructed version of that test data. Also, visualizing the same test data before reconstruction using Matplotlib
3.visualizing one of the reconstructed version of that test data to denoisening autoencoder
4.ploting loss and accuracy using the history object
